#kopimashin

Script that generates a loss of $10 million for the music industry every day

##Explanation

Shameless ripoff of a device created Peter "brokep" Sunde, co-founder of The Pirate Bay. It copies a file directly to /dev/null, thus creating a "loss" for the music industry.

##Usage

```
Usage: bash kopimashin.sh <file> [<value>]
```

Note: The file that brokep's device uses is "Crazy" by Gnarls Barkley and is not included for very obvious reasons, so use your own file. It was also priced at $1.25, which is the default value in this script.
